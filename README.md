# Todo App

This is an app to primarily teach me how to use Angular and ExpressJS. I started
with the backend and then got to the frontend. It's nothing special.

I decided to write it all in TypeScript as well.

As of now, I have completed the basic functionality. I still have a few things I
want to accomplish, however:

- [ ] Add 'flash' messages
- [ ] Test the backend
- [ ] Test the frontend
- [ ] Refactor to use [ngrx][ngrx]

[ngrx]: https://ngrx.io

More information on each part of the application can be found in the README for
each specific project.
